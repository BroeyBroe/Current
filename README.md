## Movie App
This is a basic Angular movie application that pulls from The Movie Database (TMDB) and allows for Registration and Login.

## Re-building Dependencies

Run `npm install` to re-build the node_modules directory based on the package.json file. You will need to perform this prior to running the application in dev mode. However, if you simply want to reference the code, this isn't strictly necessary.
